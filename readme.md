Made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

First off, A user can put their visited cities in the input field and click the Click to add City button. This makes a list of the cities they have visited.

It used an Event listener that listens for the click of the button to then add the cities to the list.

Second Part is the form. So far i have only done the input field for First name to be added to the Table under the form, my intention is to add the rest as well when i have time. A user can fill in their first name, click the submit button, and their name will be added to the table under the form. Very basic but i'm still learning!

Thank you for reading this.
